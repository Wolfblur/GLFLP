::Intro > 8 bit / string Sloaks::
A red sun hangs low in the sky, echoing of Dying earth. You are sitting on the Front Porch, wrinkled brain pumping under your wrinkled brow. You are lost in reverie, floating memories of the days you've left behind. The wind carries a melody over the ocean of time personified as the lake your cabin faces in the sparkle of a wind chime. It tugs on you like an insistent child on your hand when you've paused like this before, so many half remembered times through a carnival, or a wooded path, or a wedding. The sun falls into the lake and the temperature fall pleasantly after the heat of the day.

::Sloaks 1::
The wind chimes chortle to themselves in their tinny tamber, and like a crystal, carry you out over the sea to the estuary, then the bayou. The climate was just starting to rebel, and the revels still stormed the streets every February. Funny, how much you feared February, but how immediately you hermited back into it. Those years of Mardi Gras tradition, the street corner jam bands and flitting alleyways, still leave a mark on your heart. Here, now, you cross paths with so few people, but there, in New Orleans, the talking and laughing came so easy. Now those memories are just the rise and fall of voices, directional and stripped of meaning. Your body was a tumult of conflicting chemical signals. Desparate, alive, and more awake than a rushing rhino, you covered miles, processing booze and drugs, always seeking a home in someone else, or rather some body of else's. You didn't expect to remember it, but nights from that time still crystalize in your mind. Unaided by implants, your brain still conjurs up Ericka and Rob and their students, integrated into the marching band stoplights, so natural in their adopted city. And you, the outsider, saw the party through their eyes. Men and women dressed and robes mingled with the spirits of Februaries past, glistening in the Southern High Oaks. You were drunk, high, and sorting it out.

::SOLD 1.1::
Back before it became so common place, before getting to the other side of the planet wasn't an afternoon excursion, and Mars a long weekend... no, back when newness had its own merit, when exploration still meant something to your young body and mind, 21 years pouring out of your head, you thought you only had 45 left and the newness of place sustained you. You are approaching the end of those 45, and you've been a busy bee: most of America in a dilapidated van, most of Europe on couches and favors called in. The companions shift and blur together, but the freedom still sings its swan song to you.
